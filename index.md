This lesson will show you how to perform analysis on ROOT files containing information 
derived from the [NanoAOD](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookNanoAOD) 
file description. This is a simplified format, so not every analysis will be possible, 
 but for relatively standard analyses, the smaller file size and limited information
can make running over many datasets much faster. 

If you run into problems with any of these steps, please reach out to the organizers
through the [Mattermost channel for the workshop][mattermost].
